## Roadmap
*In no particular order*
- Snooze all tabs in a window at the same time (this one's coming I promise)
- Sync between devices
- Ensure compatibility with ff mobile
- Edit snooze times in the dashboard
- `a11y` best practices
- See total storage used and add instructions to delete old tabs
- Change layout of settings page

PRs and other ideas welcome.
